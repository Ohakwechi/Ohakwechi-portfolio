üíª Local Setup and Running the Projects
To explore the code and run the applications locally, follow these steps. (Note: Specific setup may vary per project folder).

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version)

npm or yarn

Docker (Recommended for containerized projects)

A running instance of MongoDB or access to a SQL database (depending on the project)

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone (https://github.com/Ohakwechi/Ohakwechi.git)
cd your-repo-name

Install dependencies (for relevant project folder):

npm install
# or
# yarn install

Configuration:
Create a .env file in the root of the project folder.

Add necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys, database connection strings, Cloud credentials).

# Example .env content
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/dbname
# AWS/GCP related keys would go here

Running the Application (Containerized)
For projects with Docker configurations, use:

docker-compose up --build

Running the Application (Standard)
To run the backend (Node.js/Express):

npm run start:server

To run the frontend (React/TypeScript):
npm run start:client
